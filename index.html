   I love dogs. I have a 2 year old chocolate lab named Nala. My favorite color is black. I have been playing volleyball for 6 years.
   I own a small business. I have been coding for a year and a half now. I am in love with muffins. My favorite TV shows are Criminal Minds, Psych, The Finder, Bones, and NCIS.
